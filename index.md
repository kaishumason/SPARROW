# SPARROW

**The sparrow may be small, but it is fully equipped with all vital organs...**

SPARROW is a method for subsampling large scale data to obtain a lightweight presentation such that most of the statistical power is preserved with respect to downstream analysis.  

It was originally designed for large scale spatial transcriptomics data analysis, to be used in conjunction with [the spotGLM package](https://kaishumason.github.io/spotGLM/) for identifying spatial signals.  However, it can be used as a general purpose data selection tool.   

The name "sparrow" comes from the Chinese idiom,["the sparrow may be small, but it is fully equiped with all of the vital organs"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%BA%BB%E9%9B%80%E9%9B%96%E5%B0%8F%EF%BC%8C%E4%BA%94%E8%87%9F%E4%BF%B1%E5%85%A8#Chinese).  The letters in the acronym stand for: **S**ubmodular **P**ower-**A**daptive **R**eduction for **R**epresentative D**o**wnstream **W**orkflows.
